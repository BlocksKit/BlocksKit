/** Block extension for NSDictionary.

 Both inspired by and resembling Smalltalk syntax, this utility
 allows iteration of a dictionary in a concise way that
 saves quite a bit of boilerplate code.

 to use bk_any: as a check condition before executing bk_match:, since it would
 require two loops through the dictionary.
