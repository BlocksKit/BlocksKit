/** Block extensions for NSSet.

 Both inspired by and resembling Smalltalk syntax, these utilities allows for
 iteration of a set in a logical way that saves quite a bit of boilerplate code
 for filtering or finding objects or an object.

 The concept of this selector is difficult to illustrate in words. The sum can
 be any NSObject, including (but not limited to) a string, number, or value.

 You can also do something like summing the count of an item:

	   return @([sum integerValue] + obj.numberOfAppendages);
	 }] unsignedIntegerValue];

 This method is similar to the Scala list `exists`. It is functionally
 identical to match: but returns a `BOOL` instead. It is not recommended
 to use any: as a check condition before executing match:, since it would
 require two loops through the array.
