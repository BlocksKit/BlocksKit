/** NSURLConnection with both delegate and block callback support.
 
 It also adds useful block handlers for tracking upload and download progress.
 
 Here is a small example:
	 - (void)downloadImage:(id)sender {
		 self.downloadButton.enabled = NO;
		 self.progressView.progress = 0.0f;
		 NSURL *imageURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/funny-pictures-nyan-cat-wannabe1.jpg"];
		 NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:imageURL];
		 NSURLConnection *connection = [NSURLConnection connectionWithRequest:request];
		 connection.delegate = self;
		 connection.failureBlock = ^(NSURLConnection *connection, NSError *error){
			 [[UIAlertView alertViewWithTitle:@"Download error" message:[error localizedDescription]] show];
			 
			 self.downloadButton.enabled = YES;
			 self.progressView.progress = 0.0f;
		 };
		 connection.successBlock = ^(NSURLConnection *connection, NSURLResponse *response, NSData *responseData){
			 self.imageView.image = [UIImage imageWithData:responseData];
			 self.downloadButton.enabled = YES;
		 };
		 connection.downloadBlock = ^(CGFloat progress){
			 self.progressView.progress = progress;
		 };
		 
		 [connection start];
	 }
	 
	 //these methods will be called too!
	 - (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didSendBodyData:(NSInteger)bytesWritten totalBytesWritten:(NSInteger)totalBytesWritten totalBytesExpectedToWrite:(NSInteger)totalBytesExpectedToWrite {
		 NSLog(@"%s",__PRETTY_FUNCTION__);
	 }
	 
	 - (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveResponse:(NSURLResponse *)response {
		 NSLog(@"%s",__PRETTY_FUNCTION__);
	 }
