/** Block extensions for NSArray.

 Both inspired by and resembling Smalltalk syntax, these utilities
 allows for iteration of an array in a concise way that
 saves quite a bit of boilerplate code for filtering or finding
 objects or an object.

 to use bk_any: as a check condition before executing bk_match:, since it would
 require two loops through the array.
