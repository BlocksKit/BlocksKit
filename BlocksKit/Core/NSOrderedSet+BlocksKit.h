/** Block extensions for NSOrderedSet.

 Both inspired by and resembling Smalltalk syntax, these utilities allow for
 iteration through an ordered set (also known as a uniqued array) in a concise
 way that saves a ton of boilerplate code for filtering or finding objects.

 The concept of this selector is difficult to illustrate in words. The sum can
 be any NSObject, including (but not limited to) a string, number, or value.

 For example, you can concentate the strings in an ordered set:
	 NSString *concentrated = [stringArray bk_reduce:@"" withBlock:^id(id sum, id obj) {
		 return [sum stringByAppendingString:obj];

 You can also do something like summing the lengths of strings in an ordered set:
	 NSUInteger value = [[[stringArray bk_reduce:nil withBlock:^id(id sum, id obj) {
		 return @([sum integerValue] + obj.length);
	 }]] unsignedIntegerValue];

 This method is similar to the Scala list `exists`. It is functionally
 identical to bk_match: but returns a `BOOL` instead. It is not recommended
 to use bk_any: as a check condition before executing bk_match:, since it would
 require two loops through the ordered set.

 For example, you can find if a string in an ordered set starts with a certain
 letter:

	 NSString *letter = @"A";
	 BOOL containsLetter = [stringArray bk_any:^(id obj) {
