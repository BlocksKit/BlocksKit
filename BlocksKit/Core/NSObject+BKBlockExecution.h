/** Block execution on *any* object.

 This category overhauls the `performSelector:` utilities on
 NSObject to instead use blocks.  Not only are the blocks performed
 extremely speedily, thread-safely, and asynchronously using
 Grand Central Dispatch, but each convenience method also returns
 a pointer that can be used to cancel the execution before it happens!

 Includes code by the following:

 reference the current implementation context.  The block argument,
 `obj`, should be used instead.

/** Executes a block after a given delay.

 This class method is functionally identical to its instance method version.  It still executes
 asynchronously via GCD.  However, the current context is not passed so that the block is performed
 in a general context.

 Block execution is very useful, particularly for small events that you would like delayed.

 @warning *Important:* It is not recommended to cancel a block executed
 with no delay (a delay of 0.0).  While it it still possible to catch the block
 before GCD has executed it, it has likely already been executed and disposed of.

 `performBlock` selectors.
